## Is Quotex Halal?

The legality of Quotex in India is a matter of debate. Some scholars
argue that it is halal (permissible) under Islamic law, while others
argue that it is haram (forbidden). The main concern is whether or not
trading on Quotex involves gambling.

Gambling is prohibited in Islam because it involves excessive risk and
uncertainty. However, some scholars argue that trading on Quotex does
not involve gambling because the trader is not betting on the outcome of
a game of chance. Instead, the trader is speculating on the price
movements of financial instruments.

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to trade on Quotex is a
personal one. Traders should consult with their religious leaders to get
guidance on this matter.
